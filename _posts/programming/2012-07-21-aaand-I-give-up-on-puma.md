My try at writing a patch for Puma has gone pretty badly, bugs that didn't make sense at all,
I think there's some crucial issue behind the scenes that I didn't notice so I get weird behavior
and the like.

So yeah, I've got better things to do, at least it gave me some ideas for barlume and made
me find few bugs.

Next train: reactor and proactor land.
