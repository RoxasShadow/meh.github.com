This has to be the fifth time this happens, I spend time working on a library all excited
about how awesome it is, loving every minute of writing Ruby, then I run a simple benchmark
and it's the slowest shit in the universe.

Now, it **could** be my fault for overusing blocks, it **could** be my fault fo- ok, it's my fault,
but it still makes me a sad panda ;_;

I love you Ruby, don't leave me like this, I know that I will just end up writing a C ext or use
`ffi-inline` to do the most intensive parts in C like I did with orgasm, but still.

Well, it's been useful in making me rethink about the overall design and surely helped me
looking at more primitives and all of this will be usefully ported to nucular.

EDIT: I am sad panda no more, while testing I realized I was setting the listen backlog in the
C servers at 1024 while in Ruby I didn't set it thus using the default TCPServer backlog which is 5.

I LOVE YOU RUBY, SORRY I WAS SO PARANOID YOU WERE CHEATING ON ME ;_;
