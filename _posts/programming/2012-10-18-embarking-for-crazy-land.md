I'm bored. I can't get myself to work on the important projects I'm planning to
work on. I'm wasting my time.

Fluxbox is getting old on me, I always end up hitting on weird issues when I'm
actually using it as a scripted tiling window manager, when it clearly is not.

I'm going to put an end to my boredom, and activate turbo on my crazyness, and
write a window manager with Zsh.

Because why the fuck not?
