Today I made two little things for Firefox, one is a userscript and the other an extension.

[linkazza](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/139074) is a simple userscript that transforms
text URLs into clickable URLs, the difference from the already existing userscripts is that it
uses the new MutationObserver API instead of the deprecated mutation events and the code
is readable.

[Blender](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blender-1/) is a simple extension that
makes websites you go on think you are using the most common browser, operating system etcetera.

It's a spinoff of [Blend In](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blend-in/) except I
use as partial source what the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en)
uses, my code is 1/5 of Blend In and it's a restartless addon.

Hope someone finds them useful.
