Today I moved the torchat and omegle plugins out of my bitlbee mirror on github
and gave them some proper building stuff, stolen directly from [bitlbee-steam](https://github.com/jgeboski/bitlbee-steam)
because it's properly made.

Now you can find the torchat plugin [here](https://github.com/meh/bitlbee-torchat) and the omegle
plugin [here](https://github.com/meh/bitlbee-omegle).
