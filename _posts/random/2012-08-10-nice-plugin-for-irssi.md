Today I made a nice plugin for irssi that I wanted quite some time, it basically adds a notification
to queries when the user of the query comes online.

It works the same way the quit notification works, it looks for when the user in the query joins
any channel and tells you he connected.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/meh/random/blob/master/perl/irssi/query-connection-notifier.pl).
