Cluster B Personality Disorder
==============================
9 out of 10 sluts suffer from a Cluster B Personality Disorder.

If you can learn to recognize Cluster B traits, you can avoid them (suggested) or, if you're disciplined enough, use them for sex.

Here's how to identify certain types of these sluts:

Borderline Personality Disorder
-------------------------------
The Borderline Personality Disorder slut will have lots of male friends, a few (3 or 4) male friend she considers to be close friends, but these "close"
friends will be friendzoned co-dependent types. The Borderline slut will have a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend she considers the primary relationship in her life, but it will always be a rocky relationship.
He will most likely be depressed. She wll make you feel like you're the king of the world when she first meets you, but this will only last a short period of time beforeshe begins to devalue you.
You have a month or two to fuck her good until this happens. **DO NOT** become one of her few male friends waiting for her to fall in love with you, that will **NEVER** happen because she hates herself too much
to allow real intimacy in her life.

Histrionic Personality Disorder
-------------------------------

The Histrionic Personality Disorder slut will b lively and charismatic, and like the Borderline slut, she will have lots of ostly male friends. But unlike he Borderline slut, she may have a few lesser attractive female
friends. She will flirst, touch, and make you feel like you're the hottest thing around. She is after your attention, and only your attention. The trick to fucking her is to not seem as if you have surrendered to her charms.
The more apathetic you are towards her, the more she wants you. The minute she thinks she's won you over, shewill consider you less than dirt. Never tell her you love her unless you want the relationship
(I use that term loosely, they will never have a real relationship) to be over.

Narcissist
----------

The narcissist slut will seem interested in you, mirror all of your interests, and paint herself out to be everything you want in a woman. For example, if you tell her you're into a certain genre of music, she
will quickly study that genre and become master at it in her own mind. Narcissist sluts love becoming getting interested in specific genres because it makes thm feel superior. They need to feel bettr than you
at knowing certain things. The minute you claim to know more, she begins reseting you and pushing you away. Like te Histrionic and Borderline sluts, the Narcissist slut wants your attention and will inevitably devalue
you and cut you off for no reason. But unlike th Borderline Histrionic sluts, they don't care if you leave first. They're narcissist and will not usually fault themeselves in any way.

Moral of the story
==================
Don't try to figure out whether the slut is Borderline, Histrionic, or Narcissistic. The truth is these disorders often intertwine and it becomes difficult to know which disorder dominates. If you do come across
these women, and you **WILL**, the best course of action is to **run like hell**. But if you want to use them for sex, the best way to go about this is hit-and-run. Be perfect when you talk to them, and then
disappear for a few days. If you can do this a few times, she will almot always throw the pussy at you. But if you start developing feelings and start trying to figure out her motives, you're fucked and have months
of heartache coming your way. The Cluster B has zero empathy (they fake it well) and are master manipulators. Don't play their game, you will always lose.
