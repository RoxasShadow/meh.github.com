New website
===========

The server came back to life today, so I decided to put on the updated version of my website.

As you can see minimalism is always in my mind :P

I'm not in the mood to work on miniLOL so the Blog module hasn't been ported to the new system yet,
at the moment I'm writing by hand the posts and using a simple ruby script to create an index with all
the written posts.

In all these days of silence I worked on some interesting projects, the first being my own distribution:
Distrø.

It aims to be an agnostic distribution, so kernel/userland/compiler/whatever agnostic, it has its own
package manager called packø (you can find it on [github](https://github.com/distro/packo)) and well,
at the moment it's paused because I'm really busy.

The other project is [craftd](https://github.com/meh/craftd), a high performance Minecraft server.

Not much else going on here, I'll go hack on the blog ruby script.

EDIT: Actually the server is dead again, I'm hosting this stuff on [github](http://meh.github.com) with
the magic CNAME thingy.
