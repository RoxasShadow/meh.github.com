Active projects are projects that are still actively developed.

Paused projects are projects I have stopped working on momentarily but will be
actively developed again, sooner or later.

Working projects are projects that I see as fine as they are, if anyone finds bug or
has some nice idea for additions they will be actively developed again.

Dropped projects are projects I don't give a fuck about anymore.
